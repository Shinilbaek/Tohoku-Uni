## Chap1 The market

1. - **exogenous variable**: is taken as determined by factors not discussed in the model
   - **endogenous variable**: is taken as determined by factors described in the model

2. **The optimization principle**: People try to choose the best patterns of comsumption that they can afford.

   **The equilibrium principle:** Price adjust until the amount that people demand of something is equal to the amount that is supplied.

3. Reservation price: A person's maximum willingness to pay for something, which means the person is indifferent between purchasing or not purchasing the good.

4. **Demand curve**: A curve that relates the quantity demanded to price.

5. Compeptitive market: in the model's equilibrium, the price must be the same, since a situation with different prices being charged for the same good cannot persist in equilibrium.

6. In a competitive market, supply curve is vertical so all goods that are available at equilibrium.

7. **Equilibrium price**: where the quantity of goods demanded equals the quantity supplied

8. Comparative statics: analyze the behavior of the equilibrium price

9. **Monopoly**: where a market is dominated by a single seller of a product

10. **Pareto improvement**:if we can find a way to make some people better off without making anybody else worse off

    **Pareto inefficient**: If an allocation allows for a Pareto improvement, it is called Pareto inefficient

    **Pareto efficient**: If an allocation is such that no Pareto improvements are possible

## Chap2 Budget Constraint

1. Budget constraint of consumer: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 ≤ m$ 

2. **Composite good**: everything else that the consumer might want to consume other than good 1, here the composite good usually with the price $p_2=1$, thus, we have composite-good interpretation :$p_1x_1+x_2≤m$

3. **Budget line**: $p_1x_1 +p_2x_2 = m$ ,slope:$-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$

   **Opportunity cost of consuming good 1**: the slope above

4. **Numeraire price**: the price relative to which we are measuring the other price and income and set it to 1.

5. **Quantity tax**: the consumer has to pay a certain amount to the government for each unit of the good he purchases. 

   **Value tax**: a tax on the value—the price—of a good(<u>also known as ad **valorem taxes**</u>)

6.  **Subsidy**: is the opposite of a tax

7. **Lump-sum** tax or subsidy: In the case of a tax, this means that the government takes away some fixed amount of money, regardless of the individual’s be- havior.

8. **Rationing constraint**: This means that the level of consumption of some good is fixed to be no larger than some amount.

## Chap3 Preferences

1. Preference: consumers' desirablity, indifferent, strictly prefer, weakly prefer

   Complete, Reflexive, Transitive

2. **Indifference curves**: for bundle$(x_1,x_2)$, the bundles on the indifference curve are indifferent to $(x_1,x_2)$ 

   - Indifference curves cannot cross

3. **Perfect substitutes**: if the consumer is willing to substitute one good for the other at a <u>constant</u> rate

4. **Perfect complements**: are goods that are always consumed together in fixed proportions

5. **Bad**: is a commodity that the consumer doesn’t like.

6. **Neutral good**: if the consumer doesn’t care about it one way or the other.

7. **Satiation**: where there is some overall best bundle for the consumer, and the “closer” he is to that best bundle, the better off he is in terms of his own preferences.

8. **Well-behaved indifference curves**:

   - Monotonicity
   - Convexity

9. **Marginal rate of substitution**(MRS): the slope of an indifference curve at a particular point

   MRS of good2 for good1: $\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1}<0$ (Well-behaved)

## Chap4 Utility

1. **Consumer preferences**:to say a bundle$ (x_1,x_2)$ was preferred to a bundle$ (y_1,y_2)$ meant that the $x$-bundle had a higher utility than the $y$-bundle. 

   Economists gradually came to recognize that all that mattered about utility as far as choice behavior was concerned was whether one bundle had a higher utility than another—how much higher didn’t really matter.

2. **Utility function** is a way of assigning a number to every possible consumption bundle such that more-preferred bundles get assigned larger numbers than less-preferred bundles.

3. Utility function -> Indifference curves

4. Perfect substitutes: $ u(x_1,x_2)=ax_1+bx_2$

5. Perfect complements: $u(x_1,x_2)=min\{ax_1,bx_2\}$

6. Quasilinear preferences:$u(x_1,x_2)=v(x_1)+x_2$

7. Cobb-Douglas preferences: $u(x_1,x_2)=x_1^c x_2^d$

8. **Marginal Utility** with respect to good 1:$MU_1=\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x_1}=\frac{u(x_1+\Delta x_1,x_2)-u(x_1,x_2)}{\Delta x_1}$

9. On the indifference curve, $MRS=\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1} = -\frac{MU_1}{MU_2}$

## Chap5 Choice 

1. **Optimal choice**:$(x_1^*, x_2^*)$,the best bundle that the consumer can afford, and at this choice, the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line, where: $$MRS=-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$$
2. Demand function: Rewrite the demand functions as depending on both prices and income: $x_1(p_1,p_2,m)$
